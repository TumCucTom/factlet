    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: <span id="date"></span></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Factlet ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Factlet is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from our users. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers</li>
        <li>We do not collect device identifiers or tracking information</li>
        <li>We do not collect location data</li>
        <li>We do not collect usage analytics or app interaction data</li>
        <li>We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or similar technologies</li>
        <li>We do not collect any data from third-party services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The App stores your preferences (such as selected categories, difficulty levels, widget settings, and notification preferences) locally on your device using Apple's standard storage mechanisms. This data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remains on your device and is not transmitted to us</li>
        <li>Is not accessible to other apps or services</li>
        <li>Can be deleted by uninstalling the App</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Widgets</h2>
    <p>The App includes widgets that display factlets on your device's home screen and lock screen. These widgets:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access only locally stored factlet data</li>
        <li>Do not connect to external servers</li>
        <li>Do not transmit any data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>If you enable notifications, the App uses Apple's local notification system to send factlets to your device. These notifications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are generated locally on your device</li>
        <li>Do not involve any external servers</li>
        <li>Do not transmit any data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The App uses only Apple's standard frameworks and APIs, which are subject to Apple's privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is safe for users of all ages. Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 or any other age threshold.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no data for you to access, modify, or delete. All App preferences are stored locally on your device and can be reset or removed by uninstalling the App.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data stored by the App is kept on your device using Apple's secure storage systems. We do not have access to this data, and it is protected by your device's security features.</p>
